# steam_ext

quick and dirty steam workshop item list to steamcmd commands

## prerequisites

- ![Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## to run

### build

`bun build ./src/main.ts --outdir ./build --minify`

### build on modification

`bun run watch`

Then load as a custom extension in a browser. I've only tested in firefox.

## TODO

- make it work in single workshop item pages
